# Rajewsky-lab helper scripts

This repository contains 'useful' little helper scripts for the day-to-day
life in the N. Rajewsky dry lab.

If you have something to add, make sure

1. your code is well documented
2. your script is executable
3. your tool is elementary in the sense of the UNIX philosophy

Currently, this repository is maintained by Dave & Marcel.
